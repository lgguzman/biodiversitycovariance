Covariance analysis from data groups using metagenomeSeq and SpiecEasi in R

##Dependecies

- __[metagenomeSeq.](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/metagenomeSeq.html)__ - is designed to determine features (be it Operational Taxanomic Unit (OTU), species, etc.) that are differentially abundant between two or more groups of multiple samples

- __[SpiecEasi.](https://github.com/zdk123/SpiecEasi)__ - Sparse InversE Covariance estimation for Ecological Association and Statistical Inference
